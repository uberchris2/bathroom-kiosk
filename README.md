# Bathroom Kiosk

In Saint Louis, the temperature can drop from [80F to 13F in a single day](http://climate.missouri.edu/news/arc/nov2009.php). Knowing the day's weather conditions at a glance in the morning can mean dressing for that incoming blizzard as opposed to freezing into a meat popsicle. Those weather clocks on amazon are neat, but why buy something for $20 when you can spend $50 and a weekend building it yourself?

This project is a webpage that serves up the current weather forecast for a given location. It uses the a weather api, and a hardcoded location.

### Building

 - Clone the repo
 - Launch the solution it in Visual Studio
 - Fill in your DarkSky API key (free) in the WeatherAPI class
 - Enter your zip code in the HomeController
 - Run it!
